The data contains observations of about 240 million clicks, and whether a given click resulted in a download or not (1/0):

The detailed data dictionary is mentioned here:

ip: ip address of click. app: app id for marketing. device: device type id of user mobile phone (e.g., iphone 6 plus, iphone 7, huawei mate 7, etc.) os: os version id of user mobile phone channel: channel id of mobile ad publisher click_time: timestamp of click (UTC) attributed_time: if user download the app for after clicking an ad, this is the time of the app download is_attributed: the target that is to be predicted, indicating the app was downloaded Let's try finding some useful trends in the data.

1. Explore the dataset for anomalies and missing values and take corrective actions if necessary.

2. Which column has maximum number of unique values present among all the available columns

3. Use an appropriate technique to get rid of all the apps that are very rare (say which comprise of less than 20% clicks) and plot the rest..

4. By using Pandas derive new features such as - 'day_of_week' , 'day_of_year' , 'month' , and 'hour' as float/int datatypes using the 'click_time' column . Add the newly derived columns in original dataset.

5. Divide the data into training and testing subsets into 80:20 ratio(Train_data = 80% , Testing_data = 20%) and check the average download rates('is_attributed') for train and test data, scores should be comparable.

6. Apply XGBoostClassifier with default parameters on training data and make first 10 prediction for Test data. NOTE: Use y_pred = model.predict_proba(X_test) since we need probabilities to compute AUC.

7. On evaluating the predictions made by the model what is the AUC/ROC score with default hyperparameters.

8. Compute feature importance score and name the top 5 features/columns .

**9. Apply BaggingClassifier with base_estimator LogisticRegression and compute AUC/ROC score.

**10. On the basis of AUC/ROC score which one will you choose from BaggingClassifier and XGBoostClassifier and why?What does AUC/ROC score signifies?

**11. What is the accuracy for BaggingClassifier and XGBoostClassifier?()
